# SMB---Samba
Samba on Linux, RaspiOS, Debian
Samba is a reimplementation of the SMB (Server Message Block) network protocol, allowing Linux computers to seamlessly integrate into Microsoft Active Directory environments.
CIFS, or the Common Internet File System, is an implementation of the SMB protocol. In modern setups, the terms CIFS and SMB are often used interchangeably, though most people simply refer to it as SMB.
By using Samba on a Raspberry Pi, you can easily share folders in a way that is accessible from almost any operating system.
Samba is one of the easiest file servers to set up and configure, making it an excellent solution for building a NASâ€”especially if your target systems are running Windows.
There are many other NAS solutions you can run on a Raspberry Pi. I personally prefer Samba because it's the most trouble-free in my experience, but you might find other setups better suited to your needs.
